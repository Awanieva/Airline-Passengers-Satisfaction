# Airline-Passengers-Satisfaction
I'm starting this month with this data challenge project from Chris French data project collaboration community. 

This data set is from Maven Analytics Its contains an airline satisfaction survey.

There were a couple questions to answer from the data set, however I added more.

1. Which percentage of airline passengers are satisfied? Does it vary by customer type? What about type of travel?

2. What is the customer profile for a repeating airline passenger?

3. Does flight distance affect customer preferences or flight patterns?

4. Which factors contribute to customer satisfaction the most? What about dissatisfaction?





The process involved in achieving this

1 Understanding the dataset.

2. Importing to SQL for analysis.

3. Answering the required questions .

4. Documenting the project on Github.

5. Connecting Power BI to SQL and importing my data for further analysis and visualization also publishing to power BI service
